# Data Structures
Data Structures. Two Types: Linear & Non-Linear. 
Linear: Arrays, Stacks, and Queues.
Non-Linear: Graphs, and Trees.

## Graph

Each node is called a vertex. And multiple nodes are called vertices.

## Tree

## **Tree** vs. **Graph**. In a Tree Data Structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices.

A algorithm that's completion time isn't effected by the size of the input is called a **Constant-time algorithm**.

* **BigO notation** represents the upper bound (worse case scenario) of an algorithm.
* **Omega notation** represents the lower bound (best case scenario) of an algorithm.
* **Theta notation** represents the average of the values in between the upper bound and lower bound.
