# Logic Gates
Let's talk about logic gates!

## The Two Universal Logic Gates
**There are 2 universal gates: NAND and NOR gates. These 2 gates can be combined to create any other kind of logic gate!**

* A **NAND** gate or a **NOT AND** gate is a logic gate that only gives an negative output when both inputs are positive.
* A **NOR** gate or a **NOT OR** gate is a logic gate that only give out a  positive output when both inputs are negative.

Personally, I typically understand a logic gate better by looking at its **Truth Table** rather than describing them verbally. So refer to the diagram above for the rest of the logic gates' properties.
