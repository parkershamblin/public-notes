# Logic Gates
Let's talk about logic gates!

## The Two Universal Logic Gates
**There are 2 universal gates: NAND and NOR gates. These 2 gates can be combined to create any other kind of logic gate!**

Universal Gates:
* A **NAND** gate or a **NOT AND** gate is a logic gate that only gives an negative output when both inputs are positive.
* A **NOR** gate or a **NOT OR** gate is a logic gate that only give out a  positive output when both inputs are negative.

Other Logic Gate, I personally find tricky:
* A **XNOR** gate  or a **NOT XOR** gate is a logic gate that only gives an positive output when both inputs are the same. The XNOR gate is the complement of the XOR gate. It is a hybrid gate. Simply, it is the combination of the XOR gate and NOT gate. 

Personally, I typically understand a logic gate better by looking at its **Truth Table** rather than describing them verbally. So refer to the diagram above for the rest of the logic gates' properties.
